      <p>I wish to write a thank-you note here to a few people who have shaped and formed my opinions, and supported me through my own journey.</p>
      <p>First, to my wife Kate, thank you for the many, many months of support while I wrote this book and worked on crazy projects. Without your constant support, patience, and care, changing my career to do things that I love to do, and writing this,<a id="GBS.0014.02"></a> would not be possible. We made it to the finish line. Time for painting, fixing the house, and Netflix and chill!</p>
      <p>To my parents and grandparents, who always told me that I can do anything that I set my mind to: thank you for your advice. You were right.</p>
      <p>To my mDialog/Google team, thanks for your reviews and discipline on my journeyâ€”I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you all.<a id="GBS.0014.03"></a> To Chris especially, thanks for your faith that my interest would be enough to help me grow into a decent engineer, and for always expecting that the team keep it clean.</p>
      <p>To Craig and Herb, thanks for the early start. If I wasn't doing bubble sorts, drawing pixelated circles, or converting customer databases when I was 17, I'm not sure I would have been able to find my way to the work that I love<a id="GBS.0014.04"></a> to do so much today.</p>
