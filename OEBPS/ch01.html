With more users having access to the Internet with faster devices and networks, today, more than ever, we need our applications to be able to handle many concurrent users working with larger datasets and with higher expectations of application stability and performance.</p><p>This book does not assume that you have a deep understanding of concurrency concepts and does try to introduce<a id="GBS.0025.03"></a> all of the concepts needed to know how to start a project from scratch, work with concurrency abstractions, and test and build standalone or networked applications using Akka. While this book should give you everything you need in those regards, it&#39;s not meant for an absolute beginner and does assume some does assume some programming proficiency.</p><p>Here is a quick overview of what you&#39;ll need and<a id="GBS.0025.04"></a> what you&#39;ll get out of this book.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Requirements:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Intermediate Scala or Java experience</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">A computer</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Internet connectivity</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Recommendations (but you can learn as you go):<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">If using Java, Java8 lambda exposure</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Git and GitHub experience for assignments</li></ul></div></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">What you&#39;ll learn:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Learn to build distributed and concurrent application</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Learn techniques for building fault-tolerant systems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Learn techniques for sharing code<a id="GBS.0025.05"></a> between projects and teams</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Learn several concepts and patterns to aid in distributed system design</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div title="What&#39;s in this book?" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"></a>What&#39;s in this book?</h1></div></div></div><p>To meet the modern challenges a platform developer may face, this book puts a strong focus not only on Akka but also on distributed and concurrent computing concepts. It is my intention to give you a toolkit to understand the problems you&#39;ll face while trying to scale these<a id="GBS.0026.01"></a> distributed and concurrent applications.</p><p>These pages are not a re-iteration of the Akka documentation. If you want a desk reference or manual, the 460-page Akka documentation will serve that purpose well. This book is not simply a book about Akka, it is a book about building concurrent and distributed systems with Akka.</p><p>This book will take you on a journey to show you a new way of working with<a id="GBS.0026.02"></a> distributed and concurrent applications. This book will arm you with an understanding of the tools, and then will show you how to use them. It will demonstrate how to build clusters of applications that talk to each other over the network and can have new computing nodes added or removed to be able to scale to meet the needs of your users. We&#39;ll learn how to do things like building pools of workers<a id="GBS.0026.03"></a> to handle huge jobs at scale to show how it&#39;s done. We will talk about important theorems and common approaches in distributed systems and show how they affect our design decisions, and we will discuss problems you will encounter related to network reliability and demonstrate how we can build our applications to be resilient to those problems.</p></div></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0026.04"></a></div></body></html>
