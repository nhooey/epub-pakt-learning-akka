      <p>The first fallacy of <a id="id305" class="indexterm"></a>distributed computing is that the network is reliable. It is not. It can and will fail. So all of our code has to correctly assume things will fail: that the network will glitch; that a message will drop.</p>
      <p>Remember the Reactive Manifesto? One of the tenets is that we <span class="emphasis"><em>React to Failure</em></span>. That is, we have to assume error cases will be encountered. A secondary benefit of<a id="GBS.0128.02"></a> using Akka is fault tolerance. In this section, we will take a good look at how Akka helps us handle failure.</p>
      <p>For the example in this section, we will look at different ways we can react to failure with our database.</p>
      <div title="Isolating failure" class="section">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Before we look at how <a id="id306" class="indexterm"></a>Akka responds to failure, we'll look at some strategies we should generally try to adhere to in our distributed applications: isolation of<a id="GBS.0128.03"></a> failures.</p>
        <p>If every component was a ticking time bomb, you would want to ensure that if one exploded, it didn't blow up, causing a chain reaction with other components going down in the explosion. You might say, then, that we want to isolate the failure or compartmentalize the component that can fail.</p>
        <p>I think a better analogy is bulk-heading, which I first saw used as an example in <span class="emphasis"><em>Reactive Design<a id="GBS.0128.04"></a> Patterns</em></span> by Jamie Allen and Roland Khun. Ships and planes are often compartmentalized in their hulls—they have many individual vertical walls in the body of the ship. If there is a breach of the hull, only that one compartment is compromised, so even if a ship hits a rock or ice, it may stay afloat as all of the other compartments will not fill with water. This is an excellent example of how we<a id="GBS.0128.05"></a> want to design our systems to respond to failure.</p>

          <p>One of the ways we<a id="id307" class="indexterm"></a> can keep a system up in the face of failure is to make components redundant and ensuring that there is no single point of failure. If we have a service, there are a few ways in which we can design the service for high availability with redundancy.</p>
          <p>One example is by using a broker. A broker<a id="id308" class="indexterm"></a> is often used to allow<a id="GBS.0129.01"></a> new service nodes to come online or to allow a service node to go offline without taking down the system. Services will connect to the broker and pick up messages from the queue and process them. JMS or RabbitMQ might be examples of a broker. Databases can be used to broker messages. Note that a single broker is itself a single point of failure and can also be a bottleneck. We'll look at clustering<a id="GBS.0129.02"></a> services without a broker later in this book.</p>

        <p>Erlang introduced fault<a id="id309" class="indexterm"></a> tolerance into the Actor Model through a concept<a id="GBS.0129.03"></a> known as supervision. At its core, the idea is to separate the response to failure from the thing that can fail and to organize things that can fail into hierarchies that can be managed.</p>
        <div title="Supervision hierarchies" class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Supervision is described in terms of <a id="id310" class="indexterm"></a>Actor hierarchies—when Actors are created, they are created as children of another actor that supervises them. The actor hierarchies are shown as<a id="GBS.0129.04"></a> path structures and the hierarchies can be thought of much like folders in a filesystem.</p>
          <p>At the very top of the actor hierarchy is the root Actor at <code class="literal">/</code>. There is then an actor called the guardian whose path is <code class="literal">/user</code>. Any actor created with <code class="literal">actorSystem.actorOf()</code> function will be created as a child of this guardian actor <code class="literal">(/user/yourActor</code>).</p>
          <p>If you create an actor from inside of an actor, you can create<a id="GBS.0129.05"></a> the actor as a child of the actor by calling <code class="literal">context().actorOf</code>, which would make this actor in the next leaf of the tree <code class="literal">(/user/yourActor/newChild</code>)</p>
          <p>There are other actor <a id="id311" class="indexterm"></a>hierarchies under the root as well. Supporting system actors go under the system guardian at <code class="literal">/system.</code> There is a temporary actor hierarchy under <code class="literal">/temp</code> where actors that complete futures go. You won't need to worry about these<a id="GBS.0130.01"></a> too much—they are mostly transparent to the developer as used by Akka's internals.</p>
          <p>Remember the sushi restaurant example? Assuming that the restaurant has an owner who oversees a manager and a manager who oversees the line staff (chefs and waiters), then, we may have a hierarchy that looks like the following:</p>
          <div class="mediaobject">
            <img src="graphics/B04006_04_02.jpg" alt="Supervision hierarchies" />
            <a id="GBS.0130.02"></a>
          </div>
          <p>Each actor that <a id="id312" class="indexterm"></a>oversees other actors can then define its supervision strategy. We will look at supervision strategies next.</p>

        <div title="Supervision strategies and the drunken sushi chef" class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec43"></a>Supervision strategies and the drunken sushi chef</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>To understand <a id="id313" class="indexterm"></a>supervision <a id="id314" class="indexterm"></a>strategies, we'll look at an example. We have a sushi chef who likes to drink a lot. His drinking often gets himself in trouble, and his manager has to take action. There are a few different actions<a id="GBS.0131.01"></a> the manager can take. We'll look at each in the following.</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Resume</strong></span>: The actor will continue with the next message</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Stop</strong></span>: Will stop the actor and take no further action</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Restart</strong></span>: Will create a new actor to replace the old one</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Escalate</strong></span>: Will pass the exception up to the next supervisor</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>To demonstrate these, imagine our sushi chef actor has to make sushi. He is very skilled and to celebrate his beautiful<a id="GBS.0131.02"></a> dishes, he takes a drink every time he makes a plate. The waiting staff pile up menu chits for the sushi chef to fill and he keeps making sushi and drinking. If the sushi chef works all day, eventually he will get into a bad state (to put it lightly).</p>
          <p>If the actor makes a mistake—if he cuts his finger or drops a plate—this is probably acceptable. The actor will be told to <code class="literal">resume()</code> in this case.</p>
          <p><a id="GBS.0131.03"></a>If the chef gets tired and makes an error indicating he may need to take a break, then the supervisor may tell the actor to stop processing messages and let the actor take a break. It's often up to the supervisor to take necessary actions in this case, for example, the supervisor would need to tell the actor when to go back to work.</p>
          <p>Once the sushi<a id="id315" class="indexterm"></a> chef is drunk, he makes a really bad looking plate<a id="GBS.0131.04"></a> and<a id="id316" class="indexterm"></a> starts hitting on some customers. The manager—who is the supervisor of the chef—responds to the exception. The manager declares the chef drunk and sends him home for the day. The supervisor calls in another chef who picks up the next ticket and continues with the orders. Retiring the old chef and bringing on a new one is the equivalent to restart.</p>
          <p>This next chef is young and can't handle his<a id="GBS.0131.05"></a> liquor. He gets particularly intoxicated and knocks over a candle and sets fire to the place. The manager can't handle the error—the roaring flame can't be fixed by sending this chef home drunk and putting another chef in the burning kitchen! The manager calls his supervisor—the owner—who tells him to shut down the restaurant and call the police immediately. This is escalate, where the manager's<a id="GBS.0132.01"></a> boss (the owner) makes the decision. If an throwable is escalated through the hierarchy to the guardian, then the application will shutdown.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Actors have a default <a id="id317" class="indexterm"></a>supervisor strategy. If an actor is supervised without changing the supervision strategy, the behavior will roughly be the same as in the drunken chef example:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Exception in a running actor: <code class="literal">restart()</code></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><a id="GBS.0132.02"></a>Error in a running actor: <code class="literal">escalate()</code></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Exception in an actor during initialization: <code class="literal">stop()</code></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>There is one other case defined in the default behavior—<code class="literal">ActorKilledException</code>. If an actor is killed, its supervisor will receive an <code class="literal">ActorKilledException</code>—the behavior when receiving this exception is to <code class="literal">stop()</code>.</p>
          <p>Remember that <code class="literal">/system</code> path? All of the supervision events actually happen in actors over there—the<a id="GBS.0132.03"></a> exception events are not your normal messages—it's important to understand this if you're trying to reason about message delivery order.</p>
          <p>We'll look at how <a id="id318" class="indexterm"></a>we would define the manager's supervision strategy if we wanted to describe the behavior.</p>

          <p>We override the <code class="literal">supervisorStrategy</code> method in an actor returning a new strategy (<code class="literal">OneForOneStrategy</code>, which we'll look at more closely shortly.) In Java8, we use a <code class="literal">DeciderBuilder</code> to create a Scala <code class="literal">PartialFunction</code> for the strategy similar to how we use the <code class="literal">ReceiveBuilder</code> for the <code class="literal">PartialFunction</code> for the receive block. While Java lacks the pattern matching semantics that Scala has for<a id="GBS.0133.01"></a> producing Scala <code class="literal">PartialFunctions</code>, the <code class="literal">DeciderBuilder</code> alleviates this, giving us a nice API for pattern matching in Java8. We describe each case outlined in the scenarios in our Sushi restaurant example and we also include a <code class="literal">matchAny</code> case at the end—if an unknown <code class="literal">Throwable</code> is received, we have the manager call his boss.</p>
          <p>Scala has pattern matching so it needs less boilerplate to express the same:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting"><code class="hl kwa">override def</code> supervisorStrategy <code class="hl opt">= {</code>
  <code class="hl kwd">OneForOneStrategy</code><code class="hl opt">() {</code>
    <code class="hl kwa">case</code> BrokenPlateException <code class="hl opt">=&gt;</code> Resume
    <code class="hl kwa">case</code> DrunkenFoolException <code class="hl opt">=&gt;</code> Restart
    <code class="hl kwa">case</code> RestaurantFireError <code class="hl opt">=&gt;</code> Escalate
    <code class="hl kwa">case</code> TiredChefException <code class="hl opt">=&gt;</code> Stop
    <code class="hl kwa">case</code> _ <code class="hl opt">=&gt;</code> Escalate
  <code class="hl opt">}</code>
<code class="hl opt">}</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>In the Scala <a id="id319" class="indexterm"></a>example, we override the <code class="literal">supervisorStrategy</code> method of the actor again, and then define a <code class="literal">PartialFunction</code> matching on Throwables and returning Directives. Here we describe<a id="GBS.0133.03"></a> all of the scenarios outlined in the example and any unknown cases, we escalate.</p>
          <p>In both Scala and Java, we describe how to handle each of the different <code class="literal">Throwable</code> cases if they are thrown by the actor: if the chef breaks a plate, we tell them to resume the next plate; if a chef is a drunken fool, we tell them to go home and bring on a new chef; if the chef lights the restaurant on fire, we have<a id="GBS.0133.04"></a> the manager call his boss; if the chef is tired, we tell him to take a break.</p>
          <p>Note that the default behavior is generally suitable—if a running actor throws an exception, we will restart the actor, and if it throws an error, we will escalate and stop the application. If your actor can throw exceptions in the constructor, however, this will cause the <code class="literal">ActorInitializationException</code>, which causes the<a id="GBS.0133.05"></a> Actor to stop. Special care must be taken in these cases as your application will not resume.</p>

          <p>We introduced restart, which is<a id="id320" class="indexterm"></a> like sending a worker home and replacing him with a new one. We'll look at what happens through the actor's lifecycle now.</p>
          <p>There are a few methods/hooks that are called through an actor's lifecycle, which you can override as needed.</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">

            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>The order of events in an Actor's lifecycle is as given in the following image:</p>

              <p>Note that the <code class="literal">preRestart</code> and <code class="literal">postRestart</code> are only called on restart. And they are called instead of the <code class="literal">preStart</code> and <code class="literal">postStop</code> methods but by default call <code class="literal">preStart</code> and <code class="literal">postStop</code>. This lets you decide whether you want to call the <code class="literal">preStart</code> and <code class="literal">postStop</code> methods only once (when an actor starts or stops) or every time an actor restarts.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>This can be very<a id="id321" class="indexterm"></a> helpful when designing. Imagine a chat application<a id="GBS.0134.03"></a> where each user is represented by an actor that sends messages to an actor representing the chat. When a user joins the room, an actor starts and sends a message so that the list of users in the room can be updated. When an actor stops, it sends another message so that the user can be removed from the list of users displayed as currently active in the chat. With the default implementation,<a id="GBS.0134.04"></a> if the actor encounters an exception and restarts, it will unpublish and republish the user in the chat window. We can override <code class="literal">preRestart</code> and <code class="literal">postRestart</code> so that the user will only add itself to the list and remove itself from the list when the user actually joins and leaves the chat.</p>

Supervision strategies can be defined to retry failed messages any number of times before raising the exception to the supervision strategy. You can also time bound the failures so that you can retry up to 10 times<a id="GBS.0135.02"></a> or retry for 1 minute—whichever comes first:</p>

          <p>Actors can be stopped in a few <a id="id324" class="indexterm"></a>different ways. You can stop an actor by doing <a id="id325" class="indexterm"></a>any of the following:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Call <code><code class="literal">ActorSystem.stop</code>(<code class="literal">actorRef</code>)</code></li>

              <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Send a <code class="literal">PoisonPill</code> message to the actor, which will stop the actor when processed.</li>

            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>Calling <code class="literal">context.stop</code> or <code class="literal">system.stop</code> will cause the actor to stop immediately. <code class="literal">PoisonPill</code> <a id="id326" class="indexterm"></a>will cause the actor to stop when the message is processed. By <a id="id327" class="indexterm"></a>contrast, Kill will not stop the actor directly, but will cause the actor to throw an <code class="literal">ActorKilledException </code>which is handled by the supervision behavior—you can decide how you want<a id="GBS.0135.05"></a> to respond in those cases.</p>

          <p>Supervision describes <a id="id328" class="indexterm"></a>a mechanism for responding to a child <a id="id329" class="indexterm"></a>actor's states—it's also possible for an actor to monitor any other actor. Calling <code><code class="literal">context.watch</code>(<code class="literal">actorRef</code>)</code> will register an actor for monitoring another actor for termination and calling <code><code class="literal">context.unwatch</code>(<code class="literal">actorRef</code>)</code> will unregister. If the watched actor stops, a <code><code class="literal">Terminated</code>(<code class="literal"><a id="GBS.0136.01"></a>ActorRef</code>)</code> message will be sent to the watcher.</p>

          <p>When we build reactive systems, we design them anticipating failure. We need to ensure our systems respond to failure correctly. One of the mistakes that I've seen out in the wild is to initialize an actor's state after it has started without handling the failure case. If you send an actor some initialization messages, with information<a id="GBS.0136.02"></a> that is important to its state, you have to be very careful because that information may be be lost in a restart.</p>
          <p>Let's demonstrate: Imagine if we make a database client actor with no arguments, and then we tell the actor where to connect. This doesn't seem unreasonable—very often in Java, we set fields in objects after creating them. We also know that Actors can safely store state, so nothing<a id="GBS.0136.03"></a> seems wrong with this scenario yet:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">ActorRef db <code class="hl opt">=</code> system<code class="hl opt">.</code><code class="hl kwd">actorOf</code><code class="hl opt">(</code>DbActor<code class="hl opt">.</code><code class="hl kwd">props</code><code class="hl opt">())</code>
db <code class="hl opt">!</code> <code class="hl kwd">Connect</code><code class="hl opt">(</code>host <code class="hl opt">=</code> <code class="hl str">&quot;10.0.8.14&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">,</code> port <code class="hl opt">=</code> <code class="hl str">&quot;9001&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">)</code>
<code class="hl kwa">val</code> actor <code class="hl opt">=</code> <code class="hl kwd">createActor</code><code class="hl opt">(</code>DbActor<code class="hl opt">.</code>props<code class="hl opt">)</code>
actor<code class="hl opt">.</code><code class="hl kwd">tell</code><code class="hl opt">(</code><code class="hl kwa">new</code> <code class="hl kwd">Connect</code><code class="hl opt">(</code><code class="hl str">&quot;10.0.8.14&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">,</code> <code class="hl str">&quot;9001&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">)</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>Now we have an actor, and, once it processes that first message, it's initialized and connected to a remote database.</p>
          <p>We send messages to the actor for a bit, and then the actor encounters<a id="GBS.0136.04"></a> an exception caused by network reliability. The actor will restart at this point. When the actor restarts, it will call <code class="literal">preRestart()</code>, and then the original actor will stop. All of the state in that actor will go away with it. Then a new object is created for the Actor. That actor's constructor will run, then <code class="literal">postRestart</code> will be called, and then the actor will be up and running.</p>
          <p>That Connect message<a id="GBS.0136.05"></a> is now lost. You can write some extra code to handle this scenario. You could write a supervision strategy or use Akka's lifecycle monitoring (<code class="literal">DeathWatch</code>) to respond to these failure conditions. But, the point is, for this simple initialization message, you have to handle this case now and risk making an error in handling the client. A much better implementation is to pass the initialization information<a id="GBS.0137.01"></a> into the constructor of the actor via Props:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">ActorRef db <code class="hl opt">=</code> system<code class="hl opt">.</code><code class="hl kwd">actorOf</code><code class="hl opt">(</code>DbActor<code class="hl opt">.</code><code class="hl kwd">props</code><code class="hl opt">(</code>
  host <code class="hl opt">=</code> <code class="hl str">&quot;10.0.8.14&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">,</code> port <code class="hl opt">=</code> <code class="hl str">&quot;9001&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">))</code>
<code class="hl kwa">val</code> actor <code class="hl opt">=</code> <code class="hl kwd">createActor</code><code class="hl opt">(</code>DbActor<code class="hl opt">.</code><code class="hl kwd">props</code><code class="hl opt">(</code><code class="hl str">&quot;10.0.8.14&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">,</code> <code class="hl str">&quot;9001&quot;</code><code class="hl opt">))</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>This seems better—the actor now gets all of the information in its constructor and it connects automatically. If we start sending the actor messages and it restarts, it will recover correctly because it has the<a id="GBS.0137.02"></a> connection information in its constructor arguments..` But, if the actor encounters an exception during initialization, perhaps trying to connect to the remote database, then the default supervision behavior is to stop. So, we have a scenario where the actor can restart safely if running, but, if it can't initialize, we have to write extra code in supervision behavior to handle the scenario where<a id="GBS.0137.03"></a> the actor can't connect to the database on startup.</p>
          <p>It is common to have an actor send itself an initialization message and to have it handle changing its state while running, instead of potentially failing during initialization. To do this, on <code class="literal">postStart</code>, an actor might send itself a Connect message:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting"><code class="hl kwa">public void</code> <code class="hl kwd">postStart</code><code class="hl opt">() {</code>
  <code class="hl kwd">self</code><code class="hl opt">().</code><code class="hl kwd">ask</code><code class="hl opt">(</code><code class="hl kwa">new</code> <code class="hl kwd">Connect</code><code class="hl opt">(),</code> <code class="hl kwb">null</code><code class="hl opt">);</code>
<code class="hl opt">}</code>

<code class="hl kwa">override def</code> postStart <code class="hl opt">=</code> self <code class="hl opt">!</code> Connect</pre>
          </div>
          <p><a id="GBS.0137.04"></a>Now that actor can only fail when it's running, and it will restart successfully, continuing to try to connect to the database until it's available.</p>
          <p>If you're paying attention, you might reason that you could have the actor send itself the <code class="literal">Connect(host, port)</code> message on the <code class="literal">preRestart</code> event. If the actor were to drop that message for any reason, maybe because its mailbox was full or because a restart<a id="GBS.0137.05"></a> caused it to be dropped, then that Connect message could be lost—it's simpler and safer to use the constructor for an actor that is critical to the actor's functioning.</p>
          <p>This is a quick and dirty look at building an actor that will just continually retry its connection.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that there are some missing details and problems with this still. The first is that we have no way to handle<a id="GBS.0138.01"></a> the messages the actor will receive before it connects. And the second is that the mailbox will be flooded if the actor can't connect for a large period of time.</p>
