      <p>We looked at the Fallacies of Distributed Computing to better understand some of the characteristics that the network has and which will affect our application's reliability and performance.</p>
      <p>Because our actors can encounter problems—both in the network and in their internal state—we examined how actors move through their lifecycle. We looked at how supervision can be used to build responses<a id="GBS.0150.02"></a> to failures and to customize how actors respond when starting, stopping, and restarting.</p>
      <p>We also covered different ways in which an actor's behavior can change depending on its state. We covered how Hotswap and FSM can improve the readability of an actor that does have behavior that changes through state instead of simply using conditionals.</p>
      <p>At this point, we can build resilient applications that<a id="GBS.0150.03"></a> react to errors and can clearly describe behavior in response to state.</p>
      <p>In the next chapter, we will cover scaling up an application to better utilize the hardware it is running on.</p>
