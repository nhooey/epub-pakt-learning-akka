      <p>Both Actors and Futures<a id="id361" class="indexterm"></a> can be used for concurrency, but which is <a id="id362" class="indexterm"></a>the correct abstraction to use?</p>
      <p>After working with<a id="id363" class="indexterm"></a> Akka a bit, in the beginning of your<a id="id364" class="indexterm"></a> journey toward creating highly scalable event-driven systems, you may likely start using Actors everywhere in your design. You may think that the correct way to approach every problem is to use an actor.<a id="GBS.0155.02"></a> As the old proverb goes, if you have a hammer, everything can start to look like a nail.</p>
      <p>It turns out that deciding whether to use Actors or Futures is actually not a simple question to answer. There is a common rule of thumb I've heard people citingâ€”"Futures for Concurrency, Actors for State."</p>
      <p>That is to say that, if you have any state, then you might immediately think of using actors, and if<a id="GBS.0155.03"></a> you have no state and only want concurrency, then you can look at futures. While that's a good rule of thumb, it's actually an oversimplification of the problem as there are several use cases where actors can give you designs that are easier to debug and maintain. You'll often want to evaluate both for your use case and consider the design simplicity.</p>
