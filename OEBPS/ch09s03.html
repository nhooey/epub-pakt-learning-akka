      <p>Finally, after talking<a id="id614" class="indexterm"></a> about deployment, we need to quickly glance over how to<a id="id615" class="indexterm"></a> monitor your application. There are probably three major concerns to examine to ensure your application is maintainable:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Events and Metrics</strong></span>: Number of successes, failures, amount of traffic, and latency.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Logs</strong></span>: Internal application behavior and details of failures.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Health</strong></span>: Is it up? Is it healthy?<a id="GBS.0267.02"></a> And, is it working as expected?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>For general event and metrics, tools like Statsd or Metrics can be used to put internal counters and timers in your app and "ship them" to another service where graphs are produced. AppDynamics and NewRelic are partners of Typesafe and offer SaaS solutions for similar concerns if you don't want to handle these in house.</p>
      <p>Logs at scale can be very difficult to handle,<a id="GBS.0267.03"></a> and I've seen some big systems be set to Error or even Off. Whatever approach you take, you probably don't want to be scrubbing through multiple files<a id="id616" class="indexterm"></a> on many different servers to understand what's going on with your application. The <a id="id617" class="indexterm"></a>ELK stack—<a id="id618" class="indexterm"></a>Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana—is a very <a id="id619" class="indexterm"></a>good stack of tools that will allow an<a id="id620" class="indexterm"></a> agent to send log events to a cluster of Logstash services where events<a id="GBS.0267.04"></a> are indexed and then put into Elasticseach for fast queying. Kibana sits in front of Elasticsearch as a very capable frontend to query and analyze log events. I would really recommend this type of solution, even if it's not ELK. You want a centralized log collection in your systems to improve its maintainability.</p>
      <p>Being able to "see inside" your running systems is critical to understand the health<a id="GBS.0267.05"></a> of your live systems. Being able to interpret the events requires views of the data that are easy to understand. NewRelic is easy to get started with as it's a SaaS model. If you don't mind working with infrastructure more, tools such as Graphite can visualize events collected with statsd to help you recognize trends in your data related to performance or errors, for example. Here is a screenshot<a id="GBS.0268.01"></a> from the Graphite </p>

        <p>To really grow with the material in this book, you'll need to keep venturing forward on your journey. I have to assume that you want to learn about building distributed things if you're reading this book. In this next section, I'll provide a few more activities and resources outside of the Akka documentation that you might want to check out to help you understand<a id="GBS.0268.02"></a> other related concerns.</p>

      <div title="Writing some Actor Code" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">

              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec100"></a>Writing some Actor Code</h2>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>At this point, if you <a id="id621" class="indexterm"></a>have not already, I would strongly advise that you go back over the homework problems in each section and try to accomplish the tasks.</p>
        <p>The initial chapters up to <a href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Actor Lifecycle – Handling State and Failure" class="link">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Actor Lifecycle – Handling State and Failure</em></span>, in particular, are enough to work from for quite a while. Build a local concurrent application with Akka<a id="GBS.0268.03"></a> first. This material, and what you will certainly build on from it, is the most important foundational work.</p>
        <p><a href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Scaling Up" class="link">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scaling Up</em></span>, and further chapters, while I believe they are the most interesting pieces, are more advanced topics, and I myself have worked on very large systems with Akka that have employed very few of the techniques only because some of the modules, like clusters, are newer,<a id="GBS.0268.04"></a> or they may not be needed for some use cases (for example, adjusting the mailbox configuration.)</p>
        <p>While I've talked about<a id="id622" class="indexterm"></a> Akka as a distribution toolkit a lot in this book, it arguably has a use as both a concurrency framework and a distribution toolkit. Understanding when to use each is a fine balancing act, and you should always prefer simplicity until you have a good reason to make a change.<a id="GBS.0268.05"></a> Very often, using futures will be enough for concurrency. Thus, it takes a fairly critical examination of the problems to employ Akka's actors in the right places, and I've seen a few cases where Actors were probably a worse decision than simply using futures. It's only through experience that you'll develop the foresight to understand where the right place is to use Actors.</p>
        <p>Certainly, though<a id="GBS.0269.01"></a> Akka will seldom be a bad choice for distribution problems, I would definitely learn the material in <a href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Successfully Scaling Out – Clustering" class="link">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Successfully Scaling Out – Clustering</em></span>, with zeal to be confident enough with Cluster to employ it in your projects. Tools like Zookeeper can coordinate nodes in a cluster, Principles of Reactive Programming. It also covers a rather broad set of concerns as far as systems coordinating<a id="GBS.0269.02"></a> and talking; not only understanding who is available and who isn't, but also how to get messages between systems without introducing much complexity to the code that you must yourself maintain.</p>

        <p>I reviewed some courses on <a id="id623" class="indexterm"></a>Coursera while reaching the end of writing this book. There are a couple of courses that I thought might be helpful to someone trying to learn a bit more about<a id="GBS.0269.03"></a> how Akka works, or to advance their own Distributed Computing skills and knowledge.</p>
        <p>The second iteration of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Principles of Reactive Programming</em></span> course on Coursera from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne wrapped up around the time I was finishing this book. The last couple of weeks cover Akka, Cluster, and related topics. I feel that it would be a good piece of material to review for anyone<a id="GBS.0269.04"></a> looking for some more information on Reactive Programming in general, and to have some more homework assigned to them to help them learn. It might reiterate some of the concepts in this book, but will certainly<a id="id624" class="indexterm"></a> help to re-enforce the topics. It can be found at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive" class="ulink">https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive</a>.</p>
        <p>The Functional Programming in Scala course is also great for learning about functional programming<a id="GBS.0269.05"></a> if you're currently a Java Developer. It can be accessed at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" class="ulink">https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun</a>.</p>
        <p>One of the best courses you could take to accompany this book is Cloud Computing Concepts from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign covers. It covers many of the topics that the Akka team used to build Cluster. Concepts such as Gossip Protocol (week 2) and time and ordering concepts such<a id="GBS.0270.01"></a> as Vector Clocks, used to achieve a consistent view of the cluster (week 4), are covered in great detail in this course. Understanding these concepts in detail will certainly help you in your journey. This course can be found<a id="id625" class="indexterm"></a> here:</p>
