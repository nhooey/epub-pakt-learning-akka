      <p>We will produce two<a id="id28" class="indexterm"></a> primary services throughout the book and recommend that you follow along. There is a homework section at the end of every chapter that will give you exercises to help put the material to use— complete the activities before you head on to the next chapter. Post them up to GitHub if you want to share your progress or have a good open-source idea.</p>
      <p>We can define<a id="GBS.0037.02"></a> two main pieces of software we will focus on developing in the book. One example will be used to demonstrate how to handle state and distribution and the other will be used to demonstrate how to get work done.</p>
      <div title="Example 1 – handling distributed state" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"></a>Example 1 – handling distributed state</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We're going to look at how we would build a scalable distributed in memory database that we will store data in from the other example. To be clear,<a id="GBS.0037.03"></a> we will build a highly available key value store similar to Redis or memcached. The database that you build will handle all of the concurrency, clustering, and distribution concerns needed for this to really work. Many of the skills you build will be in learning how to separate and distribute the data and load for our database in a cluster so we can take advantage of the hardware, and scale out<a id="GBS.0037.04"></a> to utilize multiple machines, you'll get a real taste of the design challenges and common solutions in real world situations. We're also going to look at how to build a client library to interact with our Akka-based database so anyone on the JVM can use it. It is highly recommended that you build a database like this for yourself, put it on GitHub, and show it off on your resume.</p>
        <p>If it sounds<a id="GBS.0037.05"></a> like a lot of work—good news, this will all actually be fairly simple to do using the Akka toolkit. We will take you from zero to hero in no time.</p>

      <div title="Example 2 – getting lots of work done" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"></a>Example 2 – getting lots of work done</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>For an example of doing<a id="id29" class="indexterm"></a> lots of work at scale in this book, we will produce an article reading an API that will take a blog or news article, rip out the main text body, and store it in our database for later<a id="GBS.0038.01"></a> consumption. </p>
        <p>For a use case, imagine a mobile device will have a reader on it requesting articles from popular RSS feeds from our service and presenting the main body text in a nice reader experience that can reflow the text to fit the display. Our service will do the extraction of that body text from major RSS feeds so the user has a nice fast experience on the device and never has to wait.<a id="GBS.0038.02"></a> If you want to see a real example of this on a device, check out Flipboard for iOS: it is a great example of what a consumer of our service might look like.</p>
