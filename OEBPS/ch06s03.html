      <p>A cluster <a id="id426" class="indexterm"></a>is a group of servers that exist and talk among themselves. Each server in a cluster is referred to as a node or member. A cluster should be able to change size dynamically and survive any failures with minimal impact so that there are two responsibilities that a cluster needs to handle—failure detection and propagating a consistent view of all available members<a id="GBS.0181.02"></a> throughout the cluster.</p>
      <div title="Failure Detection" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec69"></a>Failure Detection</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>As we start to add nodes beyond one, it becomes<a id="id427" class="indexterm"></a> more likely that nodes will fail or that the network will become temporarily partitioned; thus, a cluster is a dynamic entity that can shrink when servers shut down or become unavailable and that can grow when servers are added (for example, to handle more load). Nodes of a cluster do this by sending messages<a id="GBS.0181.03"></a> to other members to determine whether those members are available or not. They determine the availability of the members on the basis of the reply or absence thereof.</p>
        <p>If every server talked to every other server in the cluster, then a cluster's performance would not scale in a linear manner as the overhead of each additional node would exponentially increase the lines of communication needed.<a id="GBS.0181.04"></a> To reduce the complexity of monitoring the heath of other nodes, failure detection in Akka is done by only monitoring a certain number of nodes next to a node. For example, in a cluster ring of six nodes, each node might monitor the two nodes after it for failure. The default maximum for each node to monitor in Akka Cluster is five nodes:</p>

          <a id="GBS.0182.01"></a>
        </div>
        <p>In Akka, the failure<a id="id428" class="indexterm"></a> detection is accomplished by sending a heartbeat from one node to another, and then accepting a response. Akka will calculate the likelihood that a node is available on the basis of the heartbeat history and current heartbeats. Akka will mark the node as unavailable and available by calculation with these figures and the tolerance thresholds configured.</p>

              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec70"></a>Gossiping an Eventually<a id="GBS.0182.02"></a> Consistent View</h2>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Considering handling <a id="id429" class="indexterm"></a>failure detection, each node in the cluster communicates the known state to its neighbors. Then, those neighbors pass along the known state to their neighbors and so on until the known state of that node is propagated throughout the cluster. Nodes will deliberate and come to conclusions about the members of the cluster.</p>
        <p>If a node is inaccessible to one node,<a id="GBS.0182.03"></a> it is considered unavailable to all nodes in the cluster.</p>
        <p>This mechanism for eventually propagating the state through the cluster is known as gossip protocol or epidemic protocol (as information spreads throughout the cluster like a virus!). Many eventually consistent data-stores, such as Riak and Cassandra, operate in a very similar manner. The Dynamo paper from Amazon was very influential in<a id="GBS.0182.04"></a> many of these data-stores.</p>
        <p>We don't need to know<a id="id430" class="indexterm"></a> too much about the inner workings of Akka cluster at this point—we only need to understand that Akka will take care of determining if the state of the cluster changes and will take care of updating everyone in the cluster with any changes that occur.</p>
        <p>We're going to cover many of the details of how cluster works as we build our own cluster through<a id="GBS.0182.05"></a> the rest of this chapter. If you want to get a bit more background on how Akka Cluster works, there is a document in the Akka documentation called <a id="id431" class="indexterm"></a>Cluster Specification. At the time of writing, it as available at <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/cluster-usage.html" class="ulink">http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/cluster-usage.html</a>.</p>
