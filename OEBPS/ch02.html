This chapter is incredibly important to get down before you proceed. If you are very comfortable working with Scala futures, Play promises, or Java8 completable futures, you may skim through this<a id="GBS.0057.02"></a> chapter. If you have experience with Guava or Spring Listenable Futures, you&#39;ll want to learn the differences in the APIs presented here. If you have never worked with a monadic future, you&#39;ll want to take your time here.</p><p>The chapter will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">The anatomy of, creation of, and communication with an actor</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">The tools and knowledge necessary to deal with asynchronous responses<a id="GBS.0057.03"></a> from the Actor API</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Working with Futures—place-holders of results that will be available in the future that can succeed or fail</li></ul></div><div title="Reactive system design" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"></a>Reactive system design</h1></div></div></div><p>A<a id="id123" class="indexterm"></a> book on Akka would not be complete without a description of the term &quot;Reactive&quot;. If you look at books being published or the names of new libraries and frameworks, you may see the word &quot;Reactive&quot; in quite a few of the titles. Akka is also called<a id="GBS.0057.04"></a> a <a id="id124" class="indexterm"></a>
<span class="strong"><strong>Reactive platform</strong></span> or more specifically part of the Typesafe Reactive platform. In this context, the term has become more popular, partially thanks to the <a id="id125" class="indexterm"></a>Reactive Manifesto, which is a document that attempts to distill the qualities required for a web application to successfully grow while meeting the demands of users today.</p><p>At this point, the word is practically a piece of developer pop-culture.<a id="GBS.0057.05"></a> Of course, then, there are a few out there that may grumble when they hear the word. </p><p>This section will briefly introduce the four tenets of the Reactive Manifesto. These are the <a id="id126" class="indexterm"></a>qualities that we will strive for in our applications so that they will scale and be resilient to failure. We will refer back to these qualities throughout this book.
