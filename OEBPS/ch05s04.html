We need to do some long-running work and we need to do it many times. Earlier in this book, we looked at an example of parsing article body text from a web page. We&#39;ll revisit this example using the <code class="literal">BoilerPipe</code> library to parse the contents of a page. The article parsing<a id="GBS.0156.02"></a> logic might look like the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class ArticleParser { public static Try&lt;String&gt; apply(String html) { return Try.ofFailable( () -&gt; de.l3s.boilerpipe.extractors.ArticleExtractor.INSTANCE.getText(html)
        );
    }
}

object ArticleParser { 
def apply(html: String) : String = de.l3s.boilerpipe.extractors.ArticleExtractor.INSTANCE.getText(html) 
}</pre></div><p>This gives us <a id="id367" class="indexterm"></a>some work that we can<a id="GBS.0156.03"></a> do in parallel to examine how we can scale up to better use a multicore environment using futures and actors.</p><div title="Doing work In parallel with futures" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec59"></a>Doing work In parallel with futures</h2></div></div></div><p>Futures are highly <a id="id368" class="indexterm"></a>composable and can be a good fit for parallel processing. Using future function composition techniques examined in <a href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Actors and Concurrency" class="link">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Actors and Concurrency</em></span>, we know that we can do asynchronous work safely and with fairly minimal effort.<a id="GBS.0156.04"></a> If we have a collection of items we need to process, we can do it in parallel with futures in very little code. </p><p>In the following, we have a List of Strings called <code class="literal">articleList</code> containing web pages from articles and an HTML page of an article. We want to process the list with Futures for higher concurrency to better utilize system resources. We&#39;ll look at how we can do this using Java first:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> <a id="GBS.0156.05"></a>       List&lt;ComposableFuture&lt;String&gt;&gt; futures = articleList
                .stream()
                .map(article -&gt;CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt;ArticleParser.apply(article))) .collect(Collectors.toList());
        Future&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;articlesFuture = com.jasongoodwin.monads.Futures.sequence(futures).get();</pre></div><p>Note that we&#39;ll use the sequence function from the better-java <code class="literal">monads</code> library to<a id="GBS.0157.01"></a> help us work with multiple futures&#8212;it contains a sequence method that will turn a list of futures into a single future containing a list of the results. Include it into your project by adding the following to <code class="literal">build.sbt</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&quot;com.jason-goodwin&quot; % &quot;better-monads&quot; % &quot;0.2.1&quot;</pre></div><p>In the Java example, we have a list of articles, which we map into futures that will contain the completed article body. This kicks<a id="GBS.0157.02"></a> off the processing of all of the articles in the <code class="literal">articleList</code> in parallel. We use sequence to turn the List of Futures into a Future containing a list of the articles. Using Scala is similar, if more terse. Scala has its own sequence method for transforming the list of futures.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">  import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
val futures = articleList.map(artlice =&gt; { Future(ArticleParser.apply(article<a id="GBS.0157.03"></a>)) })
val articlesFuture: Future[List[String]] = 
Future.sequence(futures)</pre></div><p>We take the list of <a id="id369" class="indexterm"></a>articles and execute the parsing work in parallel by running it in futures. We take the List of Futures and then sequence them into a more usable single future containing the list of our articles. These examples show how simple it is to parallelize with futures.</p></div><div title="Doing work in parallel with Actors" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec60"></a>Doing work in parallel with Actors</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="GBS.0157.04"></a>We&#39;ve looked at using <a id="id370" class="indexterm"></a>futures to do work in parallel. Now we&#39;ll look at how we can similarly do work in parallel using actors. Note that, for our example case, the code is very succinct using futures. Depending on your use case, using actors specifically for concurrency can result in more complicated code. We&#39;ll look at an equivalent example using actors to do the work.</p><p>Using the <code class="literal">ArticleParser</code><a id="GBS.0157.05"></a> static apply method from the Future&#39;s example, we&#39;ll first create an actor that will do the work.</p><p>The following is the Java actor and message:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class ParseArticle { public final String htmlBody; public ParseArticle(String url) { this.htmlBody = url;
    }
}
public class ArticleParseActor extends AbstractActor { private ArticleParseActor() { receive(ReceiveBuilder. match(ParseArticle.class,<a id="GBS.0158.01"></a> x -&gt;{ sender().tell(ArticleParser.apply(x.htmlBody), self());
                }
        ).
        build());
  }
}</pre></div><p>The following is the Scala actor and message:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">case class ParseArticle(htmlString: String)
class ArticleParseActor extends Actor{ override def receive: Receive = { case ParseArticle(htmlString) =&gt; val body: String = ArticleParser(htmlString) sender() ! body }
}</pre></div><p>To do the work in<a id="id371" class="indexterm"></a> parallel,<a id="GBS.0158.02"></a> we need to introduce a &quot;Router&quot; to distribute the work across several actors; we will look at this  next.</p><div title="Introducing Routers" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec57"></a>Introducing Routers</h3></div></div></div><p>In Akka, a Router<a id="id372" class="indexterm"></a> is a load-balancing/routing abstraction. When a Router is created, it is given a group of actors or is asked to create a pool of actors.</p><p>Note the use of the words group and pool. While creating routers with actors, it&#39;s important to understand that there<a id="GBS.0158.03"></a> are two ways in which the collection of actors behind the router can be created. Either the router can create the actors (a Pool) or the router can be provided with the list of actors (a Group).</p><p>After the creation of the router, if the router receives a message, then it will pass that message on to one or more of the actors in its Group/Pool. There are different strategies that determine the order<a id="GBS.0158.04"></a> in which the Router selects an actor to forward its next message to.</p><p>In our case, all of our actors are local and we want a router with several actors to allow the CPU&#39;s cores to do more of our work in parallel. Routers can also be used to distribute load across clusters of servers if the actors are remote.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04006_05_01.jpg" alt="Introducing Routers"></img><a id="GBS.0159.01"></a></div><p>For our use case <a id="id373" class="indexterm"></a>with local actors, we can create the router as a pool, having the router produce all of the actors for us. It&#39;s simple to use routers in this use case—we instantiate an actor as usual, and then call the <code class="literal">withRouter</code> method, passing in the routing strategy and how many actors we want. This is the same for either Scala or Java:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">ActorRef workerRouter = system.actorOf( Props.create(ArticleParseActor.c<a id="GBS.0159.02"></a>lass).
withRouter(new RoundRobinPool(8)));
val workerRouter: ActorRef = system.actorOf( Props.create(classOf[ArticleParseActor]).
withRouter(new RoundRobinPool(8)))</pre></div><p>If we had a list of actors that we wanted to make a router from, then we would create the Router from a group, providing a list of the actor&#39;s paths:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">ActorRef router = system.actorOf(new RoundRobinGroup(actors.map(actor -&gt;actor.path()).props());<a id="GBS.0159.03"></a> val router = system.actorOf(new RoundRobinGroup(actors.map(actor =&gt;actor.path).props())</pre></div><p>At this point, we have the router and actors we need to be able to distribute the load across cores. Taking our list of messages and asking the router to process each of the messages will process them in parallel. We&#39;ll continue to look at the more advanced features of routers now to <a id="id374" class="indexterm"></a>understand how they work<a id="GBS.0159.04"></a> in greater detail.</p></div><div title="Routing logic" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec58"></a>Routing logic</h3></div></div></div><p>You&#39;ll note that we used <code class="literal">RoundRobinPool</code>/<code class="literal">RoundRobinGroup</code>—this covers the order in which the messages <a id="id375" class="indexterm"></a>will be delivered to the routers. There are several routing strategies that Akka comes bundled with—we&#39;ll look at a few here. <code class="literal">RoundRobin</code> or <code class="literal">Random</code> are fine choices for general purpose.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left;"></col><col style="text-align: left;"></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;" valign="bottom">
