We also looked at how to isolate performance problems to specific dispatchers in a host. In this chapter, we will look at what happens when we reach the limit of a physical host and need to process the work across multiple machines.<a id="GBS.0178.02"></a> This may sound like a huge feat, but Akka gives us the tools to get us started quickly.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Some of the foundational concepts used in distributed systems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Introduction to Akka Cluster</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Using Akka Cluster to build distributed systems</li></ul></div><div title="Introducing Akka Cluster" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec39"></a>Introducing Akka Cluster</h1></div></div></div><p>We&#39;ve briefly looked at remoting<a id="id423" class="indexterm"></a> in earlier chapters in this book. It&#39;s helpful to understand<a id="GBS.0178.03"></a> remoting a bit to see how Akka communicates over the network, but in this chapter, we&#39;re going to use Akka Cluster&#39;s mechanics instead of simple peer to peer communication to give us greater resilience and flexibility in our deployments. In this section, we&#39;ll review some clustering concepts and learn about how Akka Cluster keeps track of nodes to allow our applications to scale out as needed.</p><p><a id="GBS.0178.04"></a>Let&#39;s start by giving a definition of what a cluster is. Wikipedia states that <span class="emphasis"><em>A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system.</em></span> To be more specific about our definition of a cluster in this chapter, we can say that a cluster is a group of machines (likely VMs), which we will refer<a id="GBS.0178.05"></a> to as <code class="literal">nodes</code> or <code class="literal">members</code>, that are in agreement about all other nodes who are in the group.</p></div></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0178.06"></a></div></body></html>
