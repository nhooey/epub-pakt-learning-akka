      <p>Scaling up refers to making better use of hardware from a single machine. Akka can help us scale up more easily to make better use of our hardware, with very little effort. In fact, generally, to efficiently utilize your hardware, you will not need to do much, but it's important to understand a few basic techniques.</p>
      <p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">The<a id="GBS.0151.02"></a> emergence of multicore computing</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Utilizing multiple cores with futures</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Utilizing multiple cores with routers and actors</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Utilizing dispatchers to isolate performance risk</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Note that while this chapter does talk about using Akka for distribution problems, it will only cover a single application running on a single node and will not look at how to utilize multiple servers to scale your application. However,<a id="GBS.0151.03"></a> the next chapter will cover scaling out, utilizing multiple machines, and will look at how to build clusters of applications that communicate over the network using Akka.</p>

        <p>Moore's law <a id="id357" class="indexterm"></a>states that, every 18 months or so, transistors per square inch in integrated circuits double. This used to be correlated to CPU clock speed doubling every couple of years, but CPU clock speeds are no<a id="GBS.0151.04"></a> longer increasing at the same rate that they once were.</p>
        <p>What we see today is that processors in environments—for example, servers, computers, and phones—are hitting the market with more and more CPUs and cores. My phone has 6 cores, my workstation at work has 12 virtual cores via a Xeon CPU, and the VMs in AWS can have up to 40 virtual cores. These changes in consumer and server hardware mean<a id="GBS.0151.05"></a> that we need to design our software differently—if your application runs on a single thread on an 8 core PC, you'll only be able to utilize one core effectively. Our applications need to be able to utilize these resources—if we're running an application on a single thread, then we're only able to use one of those cores. Today, as software engineers, we need to write concurrent software to be able<a id="GBS.0152.01"></a> to take advantage of the hardware our software runs on.</p>
        <p>The term "scaling up" means that, when we provide additional resources to a single system—such as<a id="id358" class="indexterm"></a> additional CPU cores or memory—the application will utilize them. If we have a single server and we give an application more resources, it should be able to utilize those resources running. In cloud services, if we need it to serve more traffic,<a id="GBS.0152.02"></a> we might replace the instance with a larger one with more cores. Assuming our application can utilize the resources, we have scaled up our application. (Conversely, when we say scaling out, we mean that we are adding resources to a system by adding more machines or VMs instead of just using bigger machines or bigger VMs.)</p>
        <p>Given that most environments we deploy our code to today are going to have<a id="GBS.0152.03"></a> several virtual CPUs available, we need to change how we think about writing code to utilize the hardware effectively. It is your duty as a modern engineer to be able to tackle these problems safely and effectively. Given that we are getting more cores instead of more processing speed on a core, we need to design our applications to utilize multiple cores by handling multiple streams of work in<a id="GBS.0152.04"></a> parallel.</p>
