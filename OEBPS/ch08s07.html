The most important thing to realize about Actors is that they are not always the best approach&#8212;plain classes should be used when it&#39;s simpler to do so. But, in the domain, where is state and concurrency exist together, then Actors are generally a safe bet. Actors can be more involved to build and test than simple classes.<a id="GBS.0254.02"></a> There are excellent tools to help us build actors and their tests, though, and this chapter rounds out the end of this book by covering some of those tools, not only in the process of designing and testing, but also in using the technology available to better express our test cases.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at some extra features in Akka, some items related to deployment and monitoring,<a id="GBS.0254.03"></a> and some steps you can take in your continuing journey.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0254.04"></a></div></body></html>
