Because this is a book targeting developers, it does not cover deployment of applications from the infrastructure perspectives.</p><p>Because Akka Cluster helps applications talk to each other, your work is basically done once your application is able to build clusters. But building new application nodes at the infrastructure<a id="GBS.0265.02"></a> level can be an intensive feat.</p><p>At a minimum, I&#39;d recommend you look at tools such as Puppet, Chef, Salt, and Ansibe right out of the gate&#8212;don&#39;t wait until you deploy to start handling these concerns. Get to deployment automation in your dev and QA environments. The problem with these tools is that they may still be too oriented to server inventories. Thus, tools such as Mesos and ConductR, which<a id="GBS.0265.03"></a> abstract away the multiple nodes underneath, might be the right approach. They will help you treat multiple nodes in a datacenter like a pool of resources, rather than distinct entities. Whatever approach you take, as a rule of thumb nobody should ever need to log into your servers once your DevOps concerns are sufficiently mature.</p><p>It&#39;s a big area to cover and is a specialization on its own more<a id="GBS.0265.04"></a> in the field of operations, but you don&#39;t need a dedicated DevOps engineer to make this happen&#8212;you just need to work beside your operations team as a Developer/Engineer to start to grow the discipline. Start a group that meets for a couple hours a week and tries to nail down how to get your dev and QA environments under automation. Once you&#39;ve got that covered, you can start to look at how to tie<a id="GBS.0265.05"></a> in new nodes to a cluster in your production deployment environment once you see how the general automation practices work. You&#39;ll be doing your team a big service if you can plant the seed.</p><p>A brief example of what <code class="literal">ConductR</code> can do is that it will take your infrastructure and &quot;bundle&quot; applications and handle replication of the &quot;bundles&quot; across the infrastructure for you, as shown in following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04006_09_01.jpg" alt="Deployment Tools"></img><a id="GBS.0266.01"></a></div><p>Have a look at the <a id="id613" class="indexterm"></a>ConductR whitepaper from Typesafe if you&#39;d like to understand the problems with yesterday&#39;s approaches in the context of applications today. It&#39;s a problem area that has a lot of intense activity, and Typesafe has tools and approaches that integrate with applications on which you build the Typesafe platform.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0266.02"></a></div></body></html>
