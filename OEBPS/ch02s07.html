All of the prerequisites are now covered for us to begin doing real work with distributed applications. We looked in depth at actor codeâ€”creating an instance of an actor, looking up an actor, responding to a message in an actor, getting a response from an actors from outside the <code class="literal">ActorSystem</code>&#8212;and working with futures.</p><p><a id="GBS.0094.02"></a>We have enough knowledge now to give our asynchronous event-driven Akka applications to the rest of the world&#8212;we can build libraries and services with Akka and expose them with the core Scala and Java8 future APIs. This is what we will be doing in the next chapter.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0094.03"></a></div></body></html>
