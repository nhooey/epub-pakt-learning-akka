      <p>The reactive <a id="id128" class="indexterm"></a>manifesto includes four tenets or design goals—responsiveness, elasticity, resiliency, and event-driven design. The four tenets are outlined in the following with examples of their application.</p>
      <div title="Responsive" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec25"></a>Responsive</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Our applications should <a id="id129" class="indexterm"></a>respond to requests as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>If we have a choice between getting data in a serial manner or in parallel, we should always<a id="GBS.0059.02"></a> choose to get the data in parallel in order to get a response back to a user faster. Requests for unrelated data can be made at the same time. When requesting unrelated non-dependent pieces of data, we should evaluate if it's possible to make those requests at the same time.</p>
        <p>If there is a potential error situation, we should return a notification of the problem to the user immediately rather than<a id="GBS.0059.03"></a> having them wait for the timeout.</p>
      </div>
      <div title="Elastic" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"></a>Elastic</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Our applications should be able to <a id="id130" class="indexterm"></a>scale under varying workload (especially achieved by adding more computing resources). In order to achieve elasticity, our systems should aim to eliminate bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>If we have our in-memory database running on a virtual machine, adding a second machine node could split the queries across the two servers, doubling<a id="GBS.0059.04"></a> potential throughput. Adding additional nodes should allow performance to scale in a near-linear manner.</p>
        <p>Adding a second in-memory database node could double memory capacity by splitting the data and moving half of it to the new node. Adding nodes should expand capacity in a near-linear manner.</p>
      </div>
      <div title="Resilient" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec27"></a>Resilient</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Our <a id="id131" class="indexterm"></a>applications should expect faults to occur and react to them gracefully. If a component<a id="GBS.0059.05"></a> of the system fails, it should not cause a lack of availability for requests that do not touch that component. Failure is inevitable—that impact should be isolated to the component that fails. If possible, failure of a component should not cause any impact in behavior by employing replication and redundancy in critical <a id="id132" class="indexterm"></a>components and data.</p>
      </div>
      <div title="Event-driven/message-driven" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec28"></a>Event-driven/message-driven</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Using messages instead of<a id="id133" class="indexterm"></a><a id="GBS.0060.01"></a> method invocation prescribes a way in which we can meet the other three reactive tenets. Message-driven systems move the control over how, when, and where requests are responded, which allows routing and load balancing of the responding component.</p>
        <p>An asynchronous message-driven system can more efficiently utilize a system's resources as it only consumes resources like threads when they are actually<a id="GBS.0060.02"></a> needed. Messages can be delivered to remote machines as well (location transparency). As messages are queued and delivered outside an actor, it's possible to self-heal a failing system via supervision.</p>

      <div title="Reactive Tenet Correlation" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec29"></a>Reactive Tenet Correlation</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The following figure shows <a id="id134" class="indexterm"></a>Reactive Tenet Correlation:</p>

          <a id="GBS.0060.03"></a>
        </div>
        <p>Reactive tenets are not completely independent of one another. Often an approach that is used to meet one of the reactive tenets will aid a system in meeting others. For example, if we note that one of our services is behaving slowly, we may stop sending requests to that service for a short period of time to let it recover while giving users an error message immediately. This improves resiliency<a id="GBS.0061.01"></a> of our system by reducing risk of a slow service crashing under load, and also improves the responsiveness of our system by indicating to a user that <a id="id135" class="indexterm"></a>there is an issue right away.</p>
