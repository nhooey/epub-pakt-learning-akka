      <p>We've looked at<a id="id572" class="indexterm"></a> some techniques to test on different levels. We've looked at how to unit test the code in an actor, then how to test an actor from the perspective of the test sending the actor messages, and, finally, how to create test probes to mock the interaction from an actor to our actor under test. Using test probes, we could certainly test many different integration scenarios.</p>
      <p><a id="GBS.0251.02"></a>It can be hard to know what to test and what not to test. The best advice I heard was probably from Kent Beck in a response to a thread on test coverage on Stack Overflow. He said, <span class="emphasis"><em>I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence</em></span>. The thread is available at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests" class="ulink">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests</a><a id="GBS.0251.03"></a>.</p>
      <p>What I would take<a id="id573" class="indexterm"></a> from that in relation to testing your actors is to target the biggest bang for your buck. You don't need to test both the underlying behavior and the integration of an Actor to be confident that it works and that you won't introduce regressions, so test accordingly. Test where you need to be confident that it works.</p>
      <p>Because the <code class="literal">TestActorRef</code> uses the <code class="literal">CallingThreadDispatcher</code>,<a id="GBS.0251.04"></a> you have mechanisms that will let you test your actors synchronously without using <code class="literal">Thread.Sleep.expectMsgon</code> probes or in the test when using the test as a sender gives you another way to wait longer than needed. Using mechanisms like these can be better than putting sleep in your tests because your tests will stay fast-running. It's very important to have a test suite that takes as little time<a id="GBS.0251.05"></a> as possible to run—if you let a few suites get into your code that <code class="literal">callThread.sleep</code>, the cost in breaking flow or the avoidance of running the whole suite can get higher. </p>
      <p>It can be a bit harder to write the tests to be fast, but I'd recommend prioritizing speed when writing your tests because you want your team to really be able to lean on the tests for confidence. Figure out how to get your<a id="GBS.0252.01"></a> tests to run without any calls to <code class="literal">Thread.sleep</code>—it's almost always possible with the tools Akka gives us.</p>
      <p>If you are using mechanisms such as Sleep, the other thing to look out for is flaky tests. It's possible to write tests that usually pass and then intermittently fail. If someone picks up the code after you and they randomly see tests failing, it'll very likely cost them some time trying to<a id="GBS.0252.02"></a> understand if they broke something in the code or not. Again, tests where the test thread has to wait for an external event can be the cause of these tests that intermittently fail. It's better to rearrange the test so that the test or a probe is in the middle of the behavior to be able to catch the event when it occurs and make assertions then, instead of waiting an arbitrary period and then validating<a id="GBS.0252.03"></a> the outcomes. In complex cases, you can use things such as Java's <code class="literal">CountDownLatch</code> to wait for several events to finish.</p>
      <p>If you're not experienced with writing tests, I'd just like to note here that the objectives in your production code can be relaxed a bit when testing. Specifically, duplication in your tests is fine. Do not worry about factoring out duplication if having a similar setup over<a id="GBS.0252.04"></a> and over documents the API and behavior very clearly in each specification.</p>
