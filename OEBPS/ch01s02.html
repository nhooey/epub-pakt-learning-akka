In this, chapter we will introduce core concepts in Akka by looking at the history of Akka and the actor model. This will give you insight into what Akka is and help you understand what problems it tries to solve. Then, the goals of this book will be introduced<a id="GBS.0027.02"></a> with recurring examples that will be used.</p><p>After covering these concepts, the chapter will move into setting up your development environment with the tools you need to start building.
