It&#39;s important to understand the effects that changes to the mailbox have in your systems. Implementing a bounded mailbox might seem like a good choice to stop you systems from crashing, but we want to respond to the user as fast as possible&#8212;even in failure<a id="GBS.0232.02"></a> scenarios&#8212;so it will often be better to fail quickly instead of drop messages once your systems are at their capacity. This chapter introduced you a few of the tools you can use to adapt your applications once they are running at very high scale and are being pushed to their limit.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will be learning about behavior-driven testing and development. We will also take a look<a id="GBS.0232.03"></a> at domain modeling with actors and classes.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0232.04"></a></div></body></html>
