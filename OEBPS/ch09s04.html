This book has tried to be a read that shows you how to build distributed systems, and has covered many of the concerns that you should understand once you step into the world of high-scale distributed computing. This last chapter highlighted some areas of Akka that you should be aware of, some deployment concerns, and additional<a id="GBS.0271.02"></a> areas of education that you can move on to as the next steps in your personal journey. I hope that this book has been helpful in introducing the concepts that you need to get off the ground using Akka. It&#39;s an interesting and powerful toolkit. While the documentation covers how to use Akka, it doesn&#39;t always show you where and when you want to use the different portions of the framework. I<a id="GBS.0271.03"></a> hope that this book covered the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;when&quot; so that you understand how great these tools are, and how they can help you.</p><p>Congratulations on making it to the end and good luck on your journey!</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0271.04"></a></div></body></html>
