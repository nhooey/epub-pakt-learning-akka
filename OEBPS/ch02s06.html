The example had fairly simple code, but was a touch advanced in introducing remoting&#8212;in the next few chapters we will only work on local Actor systems, so the examples will be simpler. Running the example outlined here will give some insight into exactly what problems Akka tries to solve, though,<a id="GBS.0093.02"></a> so I would recommend you take a few minutes to study them. This chapter&#8212;in particular the future API&#8212;is the foundation for everything that follows. We need to have a solid base to build on in the topics covered in this chapter.</p><div title="General learning" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec38"></a>General learning</h2></div></div></div><p>Here are some tasks you should complete to ensure you understand how to work with the information presented in this chapter.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Build a small service that<a id="GBS.0093.03"></a> has an actor that reverses a string.
