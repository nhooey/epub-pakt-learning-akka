We&#39;ll extend our chatroom example to look at a couple of tools in the testkit that can improve on our testing.</p><p>We&#39;ll cover two major concerns here–unit-testing underlying actor behavior and testing Actor responses.</p><div title="Testing Actor behavior and state" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec92"></a>Testing Actor behavior and state</h2></div></div></div><p>We&#39;ve looked at synchronous <a id="id555" class="indexterm"></a>testing<a id="GBS.0245.02"></a> previously but, to recap here, using <code class="literal">TestActorRef</code> gives us a way to test request and response with Actors without needing to await<a id="id556" class="indexterm"></a> messages. Using Awaits is a more flexible and realistic approach to testing Actors, but for testing Actor behavior in isolation, there are a couple of approaches we can use.</p><p>In the previous example, you&#39;ll note that we don&#39;t wait for the message to be processed. Because<a id="GBS.0245.03"></a> we created the actor using Akka Testkit&#39;s <code class="literal">TestActorRef</code>, the Actor will use the calling thread (via <code class="literal">CallingThreadDispatcher</code>) to process the message, so we immediately get free synchronous testing by creating the actor with <code class="literal">TestActorRef</code>. This is the first thing that Akka testkit gives us; we&#39;ve already demonstrated it.</p><p>Next, testkit&#39;s <code class="literal">TestActorRef</code> gives us access to the object behind the <code class="literal">ActorRef</code><a id="GBS.0245.04"></a>, which gives us the ability to inspect it in ways we normally cannot and do not want to use. Without this, we&#39;d have to use messages to check the internal state of the actor for validation in the tests. At this point, then, we might have to add features only for the sake of being able to test the actor accurately, which is not desirable. If we can access the underlying actor, then we can test its<a id="GBS.0245.05"></a> state with minimal code and less test-induced design damage.</p><p>We&#39;ll look at how we can use this feature of testkit to shape how we might write and test actor code when using the <code class="literal">TestActorRef</code>. We know that the <code class="literal">Akka TestActorRef</code> gives us access to the underlying actor, and that if we can get access to the underlying actor, we can validate any fields and methods exposed in that actor. But if we construct<a id="GBS.0246.01"></a> our actors with the behavior in a method instead of in the receive block, then we can actually test an actor like a plain class. This can be a real benefit to creating clear and simple tests of Actor behavior without worrying too much about sending and receiving messages. We want to validate the integration as well, but for scoping in on just the behavior, we can test the underlying object<a id="GBS.0246.02"></a> itself. Let&#39;s take a look at the test we created previously and see how we can use the access to the underlying actor to our advantage.</p><p>First, we&#39;ll look at the implementation of the behavior in the last specification:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Scenario</strong></span>: User Joins chatroom<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Given a chatroom has no users, when it receives a request from a user to join the chatroom, then it should add the user to its list of joined users.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p><a id="GBS.0246.03"></a>We&#39;ll write a <a id="id557" class="indexterm"></a>method in the <a id="id558" class="indexterm"></a>actor to express the behavior.</p><p>In Java:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class Chatroom extends AbstractActor{ List&lt;Messages.PostToChatroom&gt;chatHistory = new ArrayList&lt;Messages.PostToChatroom&gt;(); List&lt;UserRef&gt;joinedUsers = new ArrayList&lt;UserRef&gt;(); @Override public PartialFunction&lt;Object, BoxedUnit&gt; receive() { return ReceiveBuilder. match(Messages.JoinChatroom.class, this::joinChatroom). matchAny(o<a id="GBS.0246.04"></a> -&gt;System.out.println(&quot;received unknown message&quot;)).build();
    }
    public void joinChatroom(Messages.JoinChatroommsg) { joinedUsers.add(msg.userRef); }
}</pre></div><p>In Scala:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">class Chatroom extends Actor { varjoinedUsers: Seq[UserRef] = Seq.empty varchatHistory: Seq[PostToChatroom] = Seq.empty override def receive: Receive = { case x: JoinChatroom =&gt;
joinChatroom(x)
    case _ =&gt;
println(&quot;unimplemented&quot;)<a id="GBS.0246.05"></a>
  }
def joinChatroom(joinChatroom: JoinChatroom) { joinedUsers = joinedUsers :+ joinChatroom.userRef }
}</pre></div><p>Note that the behavior is placed into a method instead of the receive block itself. With the behavior expressed in a method, we can test and change it without worrying about the actual delivery of the message. In the test, then, we can use <code class="literal">Akka testkitTestActorRef</code> to get and test the underlying<a id="GBS.0247.01"></a> actor behavior.</p><p>In Java:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    @Test public void testShouldAddUserToJoinedUsersWhenJoiningTest() { Props props = Props.create(Chatroom.class);
TestActorRef&lt;Chatroom&gt; ref = TestActorRef.create(ActorSystem.apply(), props, &quot;testA&quot;);
        Chatroom chatroom = ref.underlyingActor();
UserRefuserRef = new UserRef(system.deadLetters(), &quot;user&quot;); Messages.JoinChatroom request = new Messages.JoinChatroom(userRef);<a id="GBS.0247.02"></a>
chatroom.joinChatroom(request);
assertEquals(chatroom.joinedUsers.get(0), userRef);
    }</pre></div><p>In <a id="id559" class="indexterm"></a>Scala:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">describe(&quot;Given a Chatroom has no users (Unit example)&quot;){ val props: Props = Props.create(classOf[Chatroom])
val ref: TestActorRef[Chatroom] = TestActorRef.create(ActorSystem(), props, &quot;testA&quot;)
val chatroom: Chatroom = ref.underlyingActor
chatroom.joinedUsers.size should equal(0)
    describe(&quot;when<a id="GBS.0247.03"></a> it receives a request from a user to join the chatroom&quot;){ valuserRef: UserRef = new UserRef(system.deadLetters, &quot;user&quot;) chatroom.joinChatroom(JoinChatroom(userRef))
      it(&quot;should add the UserRef to the list of joined users&quot;){ chatroom.joinedUsers.head should equal(userRef) }
    }
  }</pre></div><p>You can see in this case that it&#39;s <a id="id560" class="indexterm"></a>not much simpler&#8212;but instead of sending the message, we just call the method<a id="GBS.0247.04"></a> directly instead. If we have several methods we want to test inside an actor, this can greatly help us decompose and test smaller-grained details of its behavior.</p></div><div title="Testing Message flow" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec93"></a>Testing Message flow</h2></div></div></div><p>Being able to test the <a id="id561" class="indexterm"></a>underlying behavior in an actor is obviously useful, but what if we want to test sending and receiving messages in more complex situations? What happens if we want to mock another actor&#39;s<a id="GBS.0247.05"></a> behavior to ensure that the integration points are successfully built?</p><p>Let&#39;s look at a couple of scenarios where other actors are involved, and we&#39;ll look at two main approaches: using the test class as an actor and using a mock probe as an actor.</p><div title="Using the test Itself as an Actor" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec85"></a>Using the test Itself as an Actor</h3></div></div></div><p>Now we&#39;re going <a id="id562" class="indexterm"></a>to look at<a id="id563" class="indexterm"></a> how to have the test class itself receive messages so that we don&#39;t need to examine any<a id="GBS.0248.01"></a> extra external actors when checking for message flow from an actor under test. First, let&#39;s take the following specification.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Scenario: User joins chatroom<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Given a chatroom has a chat history, when a user joins the chatroom, then it should receive the last 10 posts to the chatroom from the history.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>In this case, we <a id="id564" class="indexterm"></a>want to ensure that, when a user joins the chatroom, they receive the<a id="id565" class="indexterm"></a> updates from<a id="GBS.0248.02"></a> the history. We have two actors involved then: The chatroom and the User actor that is referenced in the <code class="literal">UserRef</code>. Because we don&#39;t care about any of the details of the user actor, all we want to do is test that a message comes out of the chatroom actor with the appropriate data. The simplest approach for testing interaction between one actor and the subject is to use the test itself as the receiver.<a id="GBS.0248.03"></a> Akka testkit lets the test itself receive messages, so where you&#39;re testing responses, you can express the assertions with an API that is made for doing so:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    @Test
    public void testShouldSendHistoryWhenUserJoin() { new JavaTestKit(system) {{ //Given Props props = Props.create(Chatroom.class);
TestActorRef&lt;Chatroom&gt; ref = TestActorRef.create(system, props); Chatroom chatroom = ref.underlyingActor();<a id="GBS.0248.04"></a> Messages.PostToChatroom msg = new Messages.PostToChatroom(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;user&quot;);
chatroom.chatHistory.add(msg);
            //When
UserRef userRef = new UserRef(system.deadLetters(), &quot;user&quot;); Messages.JoinChatroom request = new Messages.JoinChatroom(userRef); ref.tell(request, getRef()); //Then List expected = new ArrayList&lt;Messages.PostToChatroom&gt;(); expected.add(msg); expectMsgEquals(duration(&quot;1<a id="GBS.0248.05"></a> second&quot;), expected); }};
    }</pre></div><p>For Java, the points to note here are that we send the message with the test ref as the sender—<code class="literal">ref.tell</code>(<code class="literal">request</code>, <code class="literal">getRef()</code>), and, then, the test itself expects a message with one of the <code class="literal">expectMsg*</code> methods. We check for exact equality, but you can test the class type for example.</p><p>In Scala, instead of creating an anonymous TestKit object as in Java, the test class itself<a id="GBS.0249.01"></a> works, which makes for a nicer syntax.</p><p>We have to change the test class definition:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">classChatroomSpec(_system: ActorSystem) extends TestKit(_system) with ImplicitSender
  with Matchers with FunSpecLike {</pre></div><p>Then the class becomes an actor, so the specification can look like the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">  describe(&quot;Given a Chatroom has a history&quot;){ val props = Props.create(classOf[Chatroom]) val ref = TestActorRef.create(system,<a id="GBS.0249.02"></a> props) val chatroom: Chatroom = ref.underlyingActor valmsg = PostToChatroom(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;user&quot;) chatroom.chatHistory = chatroom.chatHistory.+:(msg) describe(&quot;When a user joins the chatroom&quot;){ val userRef = UserRef(system.deadLetters, &quot;user&quot;) val request = JoinChatroom(userRef) ref ! request it(&quot;(the user) should receive the history&quot;){ expectMsg(1 second, List(msg)) }
    }
  }</pre></div><p>That&#39;s a bit<a id="id566" class="indexterm"></a> clearer<a id="GBS.0249.03"></a> than the Java syntax&#8212;knowing that the test is an actor, then when <a id="id567" class="indexterm"></a>we call tell, we know that the test itself will implicitly be the sender and, hence, receive the reply. The only point to mention is the <code class="literal">expectMsg</code> method—this will stop the test and await the noted reply. The test will fail if the expectation is not met in the time passed in the method call.</p></div><div title="Using TestProbes as mock Actors" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec86"></a>Using TestProbes as mock Actors</h3></div></div></div><p>Next,<a id="GBS.0249.04"></a> we&#39;ll look at<a id="id568" class="indexterm"></a> the post message specification for the <a id="id569" class="indexterm"></a>chatroom and look at how we can mock an external actor in a test.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Scenario</strong></span>: Post to chatroom:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Given a chatroom has a joined user, when the chatroom receives a request to post to the chatroom, then it should notify the joined users</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>This gives us an opportunity to look at the joined user as a mock that expects a message and see how that might<a id="GBS.0249.05"></a> look in code.</p><p>Here it is in Java:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    @Test

        final TestProbe probe = new TestProbe(system); UserRefuserRef = new UserRef(probe.ref(), &quot;user&quot;);
chatroom.joinChatroom(new<a id="GBS.0250.01"></a> Messages.JoinChatroom(userRef)); 
        //When
Messages.PostToChatroommsg = new Messages.PostToChatroom(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;user&quot;); ref.tell(msg, probe.ref());
        //Then
probe.expectMsg(msg);

      }
    }
  }</pre></div><p>You&#39;ll notice that this<a id="id570" class="indexterm"></a> looks quite similar to the previous test,<a id="GBS.0250.03"></a> except <a id="id571" class="indexterm"></a>that the test probe is sent as the joined user, and then the assertions are made with the <code class="literal">TestProbe</code> as well (<code class="literal">probe.expectMsg</code>). <code class="literal">TestProbes</code> have additional behavior such as the ability to send messages, so they truly can be used to both mock out any Actor behavior and make assertions about receipt.
