      <p>You should try to build an application that overwhelms a mailbox and then try different approaches to stop the mailbox from being overwhelmed.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist">
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Try overwhelming a mailbox in a local actor system (you can sleep the actor's thread by a few milliseconds to simulate the effect processing has on throughput). See how the application behaves.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Try overwhelming a mailbox in a distributed application<a id="GBS.0231.02"></a> built with cluster. Try sending very large messages instead of implementing delays. What do you observe in the health of the cluster when it is overwhelmed with messages? What happens to the health of the cluster when the network is overwhelmed?</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Can you think of a solution to the observed issue of the network reaching saturation?</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem">Try to implement reactive streams and see if you can stop any errors<a id="GBS.0231.03"></a> from occurring. (It will take some effort to learn reactive streams as the material is not covered here.)</li>
