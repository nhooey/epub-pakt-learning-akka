      <p>This section will introduce <a id="id1" class="indexterm"></a>Akka and the actor model. Akka, purportedly named after a mountain in Sweden, is often referred to as a distribution toolkit—a collection of tools that are used to do work across remote computing resources. Akka is a modern implementation of the actor model of concurrency. Akka today could be seen as an evolution of other technologies, borrowing from Erlang's<a id="GBS.0028.02"></a> actor model implementation while introducing many new features to aid with building applications that can handle today's high-scale problems.</p>

        <p>To better understand<a id="id2" class="indexterm"></a> what Akka is and how it is used, we will take a brief trip through time looking at the Actor model to understand what it is and how it has evolved into a framework for building fault-tolerant distributed systems<a id="GBS.0028.03"></a> in Akka today.</p>
        <p>The actor model of concurrency was originally a theoretical model of concurrent computation proposed in a paper called <span class="emphasis"><em>A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence</em></span> in 1973. We will look at the actor model's qualities here to understand its benefits in aiding our ability to reason about concurrent computation while protecting against common pitfalls in shared state.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>First, let's define what an Actor<a id="id3" class="indexterm"></a> is. In the actor model, an actor is a concurrency primitive; more simply stated, an actor can be thought of as a worker like a process or thread that can do work and take action. It might be helpful to think of an actor as a person in an organization that has a role and responsibility in that organization. Let's say a sushi restaurant.<a id="GBS.0028.05"></a> Restaurant staff have to do various pieces of work throughout the day such as preparing dishes for customers.</p>

      <div title="Actors and Message passing" class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"></a>Actors and Message passing</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>One of the qualities of an<a id="id4" class="indexterm"></a> object in object oriented languages is that it can be <a id="id5" class="indexterm"></a>can be directly invoked–one object can examine or change another object's fields, or invoke its methods. This is fine if a single thread is doing it, but if multiple threads are<a id="GBS.0029.01"></a> trying to read and change values at the same time, then synchronization and locks are needed.</p>
        <p>Actors differ from objects in that they cannot be directly read, changed, and invoked. Instead, Actors can only communicate with the world outside of them through message passing. Message passing simply means that an actor can be sent a message (object in our case) and can, itself, send messages or reply<a id="GBS.0029.02"></a> with a message. While you may draw parallels to passing a parameter to a method, and receiving a return value, message passing is fundamentally different because it happens asynchronously. An actor begins processing a message, and replies to the message, on its own terms when it is ready.</p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
          <img src="graphics/B04006_01_01.jpg" alt="Actors and Message passing" />
          <a id="GBS.0029.03"></a>
        </div>
        <p>The actor processes messages one at a time, synchronously. The mailbox is essentially a queue of work outstanding for the worker to process. When an actor processes a message, the actor can respond by changing its internal state, creating more actors, or sending more messages to other actors.</p>
        <p>The term <span class="emphasis"><em>Actor System</em></span> is often <a id="id6" class="indexterm"></a>used in implementations to describe a collection of actors and everything<a id="GBS.0029.04"></a> related to them including addresses, mailboxes, and configuration.</p>
        <p>To reiterate these key concepts:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Actor</strong></span>: A <a id="id7" class="indexterm"></a>worker concurrency primitive, which synchronously processes messages. Actors can hold state, which can change.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Message</strong></span>: A piece of data used <a id="id8" class="indexterm"></a>to communicate with processes (for example, Actors).</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Message-passing</strong></span>: A <a id="id9" class="indexterm"></a>software development paradigm where messages are passed to invoke behavior instead<a id="GBS.0029.05"></a> of directly invoking the behavior.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Mailing address</strong></span>: Where <a id="id10" class="indexterm"></a>messages are sent for an actor to process when the actor is free.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Mailbox</strong></span>: The place <a id="id11" class="indexterm"></a>messages are stored until an actor is able to process the message. This can be viewed as a queue of messages.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Actor system</strong></span>: A collection of<a id="id12" class="indexterm"></a> actors, their addresses, mailboxes, and configuration, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>It might not be obvious yet, but the <a id="id13" class="indexterm"></a>Actor Model is much<a id="GBS.0030.01"></a> easier to reason about than imperative object oriented concurrent applications. Taking a real world example and modeling it in an actor system will help to demonstrate this benefit. Consider a sushi restaurant, We have three actors in this example: a customer, a waiter, and the sushi chef.</p>
        <p>Our example starts with the customer telling our waiter their order. The waiter writes it down this onto<a id="GBS.0030.02"></a> a piece of paper and places this message in the chef's mailbox (sticks it in the kitchen window). When the chef is free, the chef will pick up the message (order) and start preparing the sushi. The chef will continue to process the message until it's done. When the sushi is prepared, the chef will put this message (plate) in the kitchen window (waiter's mailbox) for the waiter to pick up. The chef<a id="GBS.0030.03"></a> can go work on other orders now.</p>
        <p>When the waiter has a free minute, the waiter can pick up the food message from the window and deliver it to the customer's mailbox (for example, the table). When the customer is ready, they will process the message by eating the food.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
          <img src="graphics/B04006_01_02.jpg" alt="Actors and Message passing" />
          <a id="GBS.0031.01"></a>
        </div>
        <p>
</p>
        <p>It's easy to reason about the restaurant<a id="id14" class="indexterm"></a> using the actor model. If you take a moment to imagine more customers coming into the restaurant, you can imagine the waiter taking orders one at a time and handing them off to the chef, the chef processing them, and the waiter delivering food, all concurrently. This is one of the great benefits of the actor model; it's very easy to reason about concurrency<a id="GBS.0031.02"></a> when everyone has their own tasks. Modeling real applications with the actor model is not much different than what we have done in this example.</p>
        <p>The next benefit to the actor model is elimination of shared state. Because actors process one message at a time, state can be stored inside an actor safely. If you have not worked on concurrent systems this may be harder to see immediately but we can<a id="GBS.0031.03"></a> demonstrate it quite easily. If we try to do two operations that read, modify, and write a value at the same time, then one of the operations will be lost unless we carefully employ synchronization and locking. It's a very easy mistake to make.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at a non-atomic increment operation called from two threads at the same time, to see what happens when state is shared across threads.<a id="GBS.0031.04"></a> We'll have multiple threads read a value from memory, and then write an incremented value back to memory. This is a <span class="emphasis"><em>race condition</em></span> and can be partly solved by ensuring mutually exclusive access to the value in memory. Let's actually demonstrate this with a Scala example:</p>
        <p>If we try to concurrently <a id="id15" class="indexterm"></a>increment an integer 100000 times with multiple threads, there is a good chance that we will lose<a id="GBS.0031.05"></a> some writes.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">

        <p>Both <code class="literal">i</code> and <code class="literal">j</code> are incremented 100000 times using this very simple function—<code class="literal">x = x + 1</code>. <code class="literal">i</code> is incremented from multiple threads concurrently while <code class="literal">j</code> is incremented by only<a id="GBS.0032.01"></a> one thread. We wait for a second before printing to ensure all of the updates are done. If you think the output is <code class="literal">100000 100000</code> you are very wrong.</p>
        <div class="mediaobject">

          <a id="GBS.0032.02"></a>
        </div>
        <p>Shared state is not safe. Values are being read by two threads, and then saved back incremented. Because the same value is read by multiple threads, increment operations are lost along the way. This is a race-condition and is one of the fundamental problems with shared-state concurrency models.</p>
        <p>We can demonstrate what may be happening with the race condition more clearly by reasoning about the<a id="GBS.0032.03"></a> reads and write operations:</p>

        </div>
        <p>For shared state in memory to work correctly, we have to apply locks and synchronization to stop threads from reading and writing from a value at the same time. This introduces complexity and it's hard to reason about it and to ensure it is done right.</p>
        <p>The biggest threat is that<a id="id16" class="indexterm"></a> often your code will appear correct in testing but it will fail intermittently once<a id="GBS.0032.05"></a> you have a bunch of concurrent users working on it. The bugs are easily missed because testing often excludes situations with lots of traffic. Dion Almaer once blogged that most Java applications are so rife with concurrency bugs that they only work by accident. Actors help safeguard against these problems by reducing shared state. If you move state inside an actor, access to that state can be<a id="GBS.0033.01"></a> limited only to the actor (effectively only one thread can access that state). If you treat all messages as immutable, then you can effectively eliminate shared state in your actor system and build safer applications.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The actor model evolved over time since its introduction in the aforementioned paper. It was a noted influencer in programming language designs (Scheme for example).</p>
          <p>There was a note-worthy appearance of the actor model when Ericsson produced an implementation in the 80s in the Erlang programming language<a id="GBS.0033.03"></a> for use in embedded TELECOM applications. The concept of fault tolerance through supervision was introduced here. Ericsson, using Erlang and the actor model, produced an often cited appliance, the AXD301. The AXD301 managed to achieve a remarkable nine nine's of availability (99.9999999% uptime). That's about 3.1 seconds of downtime in 100 years. The team working on the AXD claimed to have<a id="GBS.0033.04"></a> done this through elimination of shared state (as we have covered) and by introducing a fault-tolerance mechanism in Erlang: Supervision.</p>
          <p>Fault-tolerance<a id="id17" class="indexterm"></a> is gained in the actor model through<a id="id18" class="indexterm"></a> supervision. Supervision is more or less moving the responsibility of responding to failure outside of the thing that can fail. Practically speaking, this means that an actor can have other child actors that<a id="GBS.0033.05"></a> it is responsible for supervising; it monitors the child actor for failures and can take actions regarding the child actor's lifecycle. When an error is encountered in an actor that is running, the default supervision behavior is to restart (effectively recreate) the actor that encountered the failure. This response to failure—the recreating the component that fails—assumes that if an unexpected<a id="GBS.0034.01"></a> error is encountered that it could be a result of bad state, and so throwing away and re-creating the failing piece of the application can restore it to working order. It is possible to write custom responses as supervision strategies so almost any action can be taken to <a id="id19" class="indexterm"></a>restore working order to the application.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Business today demands<a id="id21" class="indexterm"></a> that the capable engineers be able to design systems that can <a id="id22" class="indexterm"></a><a id="GBS.0034.03"></a>serve traffic to thousands of users concurrently and a single machine is not enough to do that. Further, multi-core processors are becoming more prevalent so distributing across those cores is becoming important to ensure our software can take advantage of the hardware that it runs on.</p>
          <p>Akka takes the actor model and continues to evolve it by introducing an important capability for today's engineers:<a id="GBS.0034.04"></a> distribution across the network. Akka presents itself as a toolkit for fault-tolerant distribution. That is, Akka is a tool kit for working across the physical boundaries of servers to scale almost indefinitely while maintaining high availability. In recent releases, many of the features added to Akka are related to solving problems related to networked system. Akka clusters was introduced recently<a id="GBS.0035.01"></a> which allows an actor system to span multiple machines transparently, and Akka IO<a id="id23" class="indexterm"></a> and Akka HTTP<a id="id24" class="indexterm"></a> are now in the core libraries to help us interact with other systems more easily. One of Akka's key contributions to the actor model is the concept of location transparency—that is, an actor's mailing address can actually be a remote location but the location is more or less transparent to the developer<a id="GBS.0035.02"></a> so the code produced is more or less identical.</p>
          <p>Akka extends on what Erlang did with the actor model and breaks down the physical barriers of the actor system. Akka adds remoting and location transparency, that is, the mailbox of an actor could suddenly be on a remote machine and Akka would abstract away the transmission of the message over the network.</p>
          <p>More recently, Akka introduced Cluster.<a id="GBS.0035.03"></a> Akka Cluster<a id="id25" class="indexterm"></a> uses modern approaches similar to what you might see in distributed systems influenced by the Amazon Dynamo paper such as Dynamo, Cassandra, and Riak. With Cluster, an actor system can exist across multiple machines and nodes will gossip and communicate about state to other members to allow an elastic Akka cluster with no single point of failure. The mechanism is similar to Dynamo<a id="GBS.0035.04"></a> style databases <a id="id26" class="indexterm"></a>such as Riak and Cassandra. This is an incredible feature that makes creating elastic, fault-tolerant systems quite simple.</p>
          <p>Typesafe , the company<a id="id27" class="indexterm"></a> that provides technologies like Scala and Akka, are continuing to push forward distributed computing with a plethora of networking tools such as Akka IO and Akka HTTP. Further, Typesafe have been involved in the Reactive Streams proposal<a id="GBS.0035.05"></a> and Akka has one of the first implementations for producing non-blocking back-pressure for asynchronous processing.</p>
