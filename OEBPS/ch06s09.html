This gives you a few models that you can use for various problems—don&#39;t simply think of sharding/partitioning when dealing with data—you can use similar techniques for many real-time system problems to be able to scale out.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to learn more about the techniques introduced here,<a id="GBS.0215.02"></a> you should both continue your learning and try to build the solutions to these problems yourself. In my humble opinion, the best way to learn is to teach and share, so try to start a distributed computing club or otherwise get some presentations together for your peers on how these technologies work&#8212;organizing your thoughts will help you get into the details and find your own way in discovering<a id="GBS.0215.03"></a> how we&#39;re moving to solve these types of distributed computing problems today.</p><p>In the next chapter, we&#39;ll discuss what happens in mailboxes when our actors get put under heavy load and look at how we can adjust mailbox configuration to adapt to those conditions.</p></div><div style="display:none;"><a id="GBS.0215.04"></a></div></body></html>
