      <p>We've covered the reactive tenets <a id="id502" class="indexterm"></a>in previous chapters. The behavior of our application violates a couple of the reactive tenets: resiliency and responsiveness.</p>
      <p>We'll ignore responsiveness for now and focus on how we can change our application to stay up instead of crashing when it's overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>The crashing is caused by an unbounded mailbox, so we can start by changing the mailbox<a id="GBS.0220.02"></a> of the actor. An unbounded mailbox is an un-defensive position—we assert that our application will always catch up and handle messages if we don't put a limit on its size.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Up to this point, we've largely<a id="id503" class="indexterm"></a> ignored mailboxes. We've simply known that messages get placed there, and then messages are processed. That's a perfectly fine level of abstraction for you until you're facing a reasonably<a id="GBS.0220.03"></a> large scale usage. That's why this chapter is at the end of this book—you're introduced to the mailbox very early, but you might not need to tune it until you're handling real traffic.</p>

          <p>Mailboxes are configured in<a id="id504" class="indexterm"></a> Akka in one of several different ways. You can refer to the <a id="id505" class="indexterm"></a>Akka Mailboxes documentation (<a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/mailboxes.html" class="ulink">https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/mailboxes.html</a>) if you need<a id="GBS.0220.04"></a> more details.</p>
          <p>In nearly all cases, actors get their own mailboxes, with the exception being <code class="literal">BalancingDispatcher</code> used by <code class="literal">BalancingPool</code>, which shares a mailbox between all of its actors as covered in <a href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Scaling Up" class="link">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scaling Up</em></span>. So there are two areas where an Actor's mailbox is determined—in the actor configuration and in the dispatcher configuration.</p>
          <p>We'll cover the different ways in which the mailbox<a id="GBS.0220.05"></a> configuration can be set.</p>
          <div title="Selecting a mailbox in deployment configuration" class="section">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>

                  <h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl4sec27"></a>Selecting a mailbox in deployment configuration</h4>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>We've <a id="id506" class="indexterm"></a>programmatically defined<a id="id507" class="indexterm"></a> and instantiated actors. Akka's deployment configuration can also be used to configure actors and routers from the configuration file.</p>
            <p>You can define an actor's mailbox (by actor path) in the deployment configuration. If this is defined, this will take priority over any other configured mailboxes.<a id="GBS.0221.01"></a> In application.conf, you would define an actor's mailbox like the following:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">akka.actor.deployment { /myactor { mailbox = default-mailbox } }</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The actor created at <code class="literal">/user/myactor</code> would then have the default mailbox:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">ActorRefclusterController = system.actorOf(Props.create(MyActor.class), "myactor"); system.actorOf(Props[MyActor], "myactor")</pre>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div title="Selecting a mailbox in code" class="section">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>
                <div>
                  <h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl4sec28"></a>Selecting a mailbox in code</h4>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>You can also <a id="id508" class="indexterm"></a>define which<a id="GBS.0221.02"></a> mailbox is used in code. <code class="literal">Props</code> has a <code class="literal">withMailbox</code> method<a id="id509" class="indexterm"></a> that can be called to assign a mailbox when the actor is created:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">ActorRefclusterController = system.actorOf(Props.create(MyActor.class).withMailbox("default-mailbox")); system.actorOf(Props[MyActor].withMailbox("default-mailbox")</pre>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

              <div>
                <h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec82"></a>Deciding which mailbox to use</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The default mailbox <a id="id510" class="indexterm"></a>will work with all use cases including <code class="literal">BalancingPool/BalancingDispatcher</code><a id="GBS.0221.03"></a>, where a mailbox is shared between multiple actors.</p>
          <p>Unless you're using the <code class="literal">BalancingPool</code>, you will always have a single consumer of messages from the mailbox.</p>
          <div class="mediaobject">
            <img src="graphics/B04006_07_05.jpg" alt="Deciding which mailbox to use" />
            <a id="GBS.0221.04"></a>
          </div>
          <p>Instead of using the default mailbox, in this case you can use <code class="literal">SingleConsumerOnlyUnboundedMailbox</code>, which can be more efficient than the default mailbox in most cases (remember to always measure performance related changes). The only time you cannot use this mailbox is with <code class="literal">BalancingPool/BalancingDispatcher</code>, where multiple actors consume messages from the same mailbox. The queue implementation<a id="GBS.0222.01"></a> is single-consumer only.</p>
          <p>First we'll define a mailbox in our application.conf:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">akka.actor.mymailbox{ mailbox-type = "akka.dispatch.SingleConsumerOnlyUnboundedMailbox" }</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Then we can make the actors with the mailbox:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">ActorRefclusterController = system.actorOf(Props.create(MyActor.class).withMailbox("akka.actor.mymailbox")); system.actorOf(Props[MyActor].withMailbox("akka.actor.mymailbox")</pre>
          </div>
          <p>We will<a id="GBS.0222.02"></a> often need to <a id="id511" class="indexterm"></a>decide whether we want to use a bounded or unbounded mailbox. Unbounded mailboxes are preferable in most cases for performance reasons, but what we've set out to do in our example is to use a bounded mailbox to drop messages. We don't want to run out of memory if we get overwhelmed—we would rather drop some messages.</p>
          <p>There are two types of bounded mailboxes—blocking and non-blocking.<a id="GBS.0222.03"></a> All mailboxes are backed by queues. Blocking versus non-blocking in this case means that the delivery of a message to a full mailbox will either cause the thread to wait until there is room (blocking) or will drop the message (non-blocking.) We've decided to drop the messages so we can settle on the <code class="literal">NonBlockingBoundedMailbox</code>. We'll add the mailbox in our configuration:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">akka.actor.boundedmailbox{<a id="GBS.0222.04"></a> mailbox-type = "akka.dispatch.NonBlockingBoundedMailbox" mailbox-capacity = 1000000 }</pre>
          </div>
          <p>And then instantiate the actors with it:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">ActorRefclusterController = system.actorOf(Props.create(MyActor.class).withMailbox("akka.actor.boundedmailbox")); system.actorOf(Props[MyActor].withMailbox("akka.actor.boundedmailbox")</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Now, if our system gets overwhelmed, we'll lose some messages, but things will stay<a id="GBS.0222.05"></a> up.</p>
          <p>What happens if messages get dropped? Well, your systems that communicate with downstream systems should have timeout and retry semantics baked in. You can expect that messages will get dropped occasionally, so if you need at least once processing, you need to build your systems to keep track of requests and retry them if they fail for any reason. In the case of our example application, the<a id="GBS.0223.01"></a> client will probably get an error, so the user can choose to retry. In your own systems, timeout and retry mechanisms can easily be built.</p>
          <div title="Prioritizing messages in mailboxes" class="section">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>
                <div>
                  <h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl4sec29"></a>Prioritizing messages in mailboxes</h4>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>There are two other <a id="id512" class="indexterm"></a>families of mailboxes that you should be aware of: priority<a id="id513" class="indexterm"></a> mailboxes and control aware mailboxes. They both serve a similar purpose: allowing the ordering of messages.</p>
            <p>Priority mailboxes allow messages<a id="GBS.0223.02"></a> to be prioritized and sorted after they are delivered to the mailbox. This has a fairly significant performance overhead: the queue that backs the mailbox—java <code class="literal">BlockingPriorityQueue</code>—has to reorder messages as they come in, which means that both producers and consumers of the queue have to wait around while messages are shuffled around. Fortunately, there aren't many cases where reordering messages<a id="GBS.0223.03"></a> is important, so you won't need to use these mailboxes in most use cases.</p>
            <p>There is one case, though, that would be common, and that's if you need to give your actor some sort of control message to let them know that something has changed that will affect how they process any queued messages.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, there is another mailbox type—a <code class="literal">ControlMessageAware</code> mailbox—that handles messages with an<a id="GBS.0223.04"></a> efficient queue but allows any message that extends <code class="literal">akka.dispatch.Controlmessage</code> goes to the front of the queue. This is a much better solution than priority mailboxes and should be your preference if you need to get a message to an actor in front of the rest of the queue without more complex ordering.</p>
            <p>We don't need to look at these in depth as they are very rarely used, but it's important to<a id="GBS.0223.05"></a> understand that they do exist. The Akka documentation covers their use in greater detail.</p>
            <p>As one final note, it's worth mentioning that if none of the mailboxes fit your use case, then you can create your own.</p>
